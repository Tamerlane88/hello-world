# hello-world
Simple tutorial project

Okay, this will be quick.  I'm attempting to teach myself programming and web development via the odin project.  This will take a while at the current rate because I'm also typing on a dvorak keyboard.  Need to really look into learning touch typing in a more dedicated manner.
